Jack Hagel, Staff Writer. Redevelopment of the World Trade Center site in New York is getting some input from a Raleigh real-estate maven. York Properties President Smedes York was chairman of an Urban Land Institute panel at the World Trade Center and Lower Manhattan Summit last month. York was chairman of the Urban Land Institute, a Washington nonprofit organization, from 1989 to 1991. His dad, J.W. \"Willie\" York, joined the Urban Land Institute in 1947. That's where he met   J.C. Nichols, the developer of Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Mo. - the center that inspired Willie York to build Raleigh\'s Cameron Village, the Southeast\'s first shopping center.
